# Game Projects
The resume and LinkedIn links detail my work experience on enterprise web applications, but this portfolio website details the game projects I have pursued outside of a corporate structure.

As one of the two programmers on this two day project, I coded how the sound projectile moved and interacted with obstacles in game. I also handled the basic animations of the moving characters, and worked with the artists to ensure the level was laid out how they envisioned.

## Romskip Saga

This tale of space vikings comes from the final capstone course of the UT Game Development program. In this project, I worked with the artists and other programmers to layout the 2D assets in-game, with appropriate mechanics. In particular, I developed all the AI for the enemies in the game. I also played a large role in defining the actions the player character could take, such as climbing over platforms, and jumping off cliffs.

## GalactiCombat

The first game project I worked on as part of the UT Game Development program. As part of a team of 3 programmers, I wrote all the code for movement, networking, and AI. The included README.pdf indicates all the instructions for linux machines, the original platform for this project. I have since ported it over to Windows, so now it needs to be run with GalactiCombat.exe.

## LIBnation

The first game I ever made. It doesn't get much simpler than this: 2 2D characters on a single plane, with basic movements, attack, and health. Originally created as a java applet to run in-browser, it has been updated to use JNLP, as applets have deprecated.

## Finullinator

This incomplete project was my first attempt at creating my own game engine. There may not be much worth examining in this project, but it holds a special place in my heart.
