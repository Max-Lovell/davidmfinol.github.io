As one of the two programmers on this two day project, I coded how the sound projectile moved and interacted with obstacles in game. I also handled the basic animations of the moving characters, and worked with the artists to ensure the level was laid out how they envisioned.

## Romskip Saga

## GalactiCombat

The first game project I worked on as part of the UT Game Development program. As part of a 3 person team, I wrote all the code for movement, networking, and AI.

The first game I ever made. It doesn't get much simpler than this: 2 2D characters on a single plane, with basic movements, attack, and health. Originally created as a java applet to run in-browser, it has been updated to use JNLP, as applets have deprecated.

This incomplete project was my first attempt at creating my own game engine. There may not be much worth examining in this project, but it holds a special place in my heart.
